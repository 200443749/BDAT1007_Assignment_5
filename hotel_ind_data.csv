The Omni King Edward Hotel,5,Liked,Travelled with family,I loved the historic interior of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and satisfied all requests in a timely manner. I highly recommend staying at this hotel as it was valuable and close range to basically everything in the city.
The Omni King Edward Hotel,5,Liked,Business Traveller,I love everything about the hotel. It was clean and very high class. Checking in and out was easy and no issues. It is so quiet and relaxing which was the reason I went there for. I will stay there again and actually it's the best hotel I have ever been. I am making this hotel my number one get away relaxing hotel. I love it!

The Omni King Edward Hotel,2,Disliked,Business Traveller,"I wasn’t asked to upgrade my room. I started itching from the beds sheets after laying in the bed. There was no free water, I had to pay $1.75 for 4 waters. The room was extremely small and they claimed I was in an executive suite but it was a standard room. The parking was horrible and separated building and had no connection to the hotel. There was no food in the rooms we had to call Uber eats. They are promoting and advertising a restaurant and when I arrived there was a empty hotel."

Four Seasons Hotel Toronto,5,Liked,Travelled with partner,"Difficult to truly describe the level of service, from the doormen to the person checking your temperature before you enter the lobby the attention to detail was incredible. Room service was on time and piping hot with our maple salmon and again with breakfast in the morning. I can’t express how impressive the entire staff was. Lastly the hotel is spotless, gorgeous and modern."
Four Seasons Hotel Toronto,5,Liked,Business Traveller,"Four Seasons Hotel had one of the most exceptional services and every single staffs were very friendly and provided the best comfort to us. Also, kept our room very clean and beautiful every time, when we ask for housekeeping. Room service was also great!"
Four Seasons Hotel Toronto,5,Liked,Travelled with family,"The decor was amazing! Staff incredibly friendly and accommodating. Only negative was COFFEE!! the espresso bar in the room is nice, bur my husband and i are COFFEE drinkers, and it was kind of a hide n seek game tonfind a place within the hotel to get a tall, black coffee. We ended up purchasing ""to-go"" cups from the cafe boulard, but it seeked a littlebstrange to not have an actual coffee shop or coffee bar elsewhere."
Four Seasons Hotel Toronto,5,Liked,Business Traveller,"I had a late check-in on New Years Eve, and Ethan was super helpful and kind. He made the check-in process quick, and we were able to get to our room to freshen up. When we got to the room, it was very clean, well-conditioned, and the room was beautifully decorated. Once we have freshen up and headed downstairs, Ethan offered to walked us over to the hotel bar where they had a New Years Eve celebration. Since we were hotel guests, the cover charge was discounted and we got to skip the waiting line. You can never go wrong at any Four Seasons property, and the Toronto location is no exception! Most importantly, thank you Ethan for the outstanding service. We look forward to coming back!"
Four Seasons Hotel Toronto,4,Liked,Travelled with partner,Good Property in a good location. My only reservation is that the room we were assigned was substandard relative to the category for which we paid.
The Yorkville Royal Sonesta Hotel Toronto,5,Liked,Business Traveller,"Amazing location, wonderful staff, and the facilities are impecable. Will stay again!"
The Yorkville Royal Sonesta Hotel Toronto,1,Disliked,Business Traveller,"I must say I was super disappointed with this hotel. On the first day I was given expired Nespresso pods, the housekeeper tried to tell me it was the manufacturing date, although it clearly said it was the expiry and the manufacturing date was also listed separately and clearly labeled. At one point my TV wasn’t working, at another point the wifi was down (although this was dealt with relatively quickly) and on one night my shower ran completely cold, which was arguably the most upsetting part because I was forced to take a cold shower. I’d recommend looking into other hotels."
The Yorkville Royal Sonesta Hotel Toronto,4,Liked,Travelled with partner,"The room was spacious and clean. We liked the view of the private backyard, it meant we could open the window to get fresh air. The air conditioning wasn't on, probably owing to time of year. The A/C fan was a bit noisy. COVID restrictions were in place so it allowed us to try room service and found it to be excellent."
The Yorkville Royal Sonesta Hotel Toronto,5,Liked,Travelled with family,"Our room was very clean and the king sized bed was comfortable. Recommended. Avoid the expensive valet parking. Instead, access the green P parking lot off Bedford, which is right behind/under the building."

Sandman Signature Toronto Airport Hotel,5,Liked,Travelled with family,"Staff on both check in and check out were outstanding. Room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Only weak point was the IPTV."
Sandman Signature Toronto Airport Hotel,1,Disliked,Business Traveller,Did not like anything the hotel had broken class and I told them and still there the nest evening and no one cleaned the room in 2 days I will never even walk in there again
Sandman Signature Toronto Airport Hotel,2,Disliked,Travelled with partner,The room wasn’t clean at all and also the staff at the front desk was pretty rude. And online Google and the hotel website it says that they have a shuttle from the airport to the hotel but I had to take an Uber because the shuttle service isn’t available
Sandman Signature Toronto Airport Hotel,5,Liked,Travelled with family,"This motel is always so clean, friendly staff! Beds are super comfortable with lots of pillows and the bathtubs are super deep! Was very satisfied with the hand sanitizing stations as well!"

Fairmont Royal York,5,Liked,Travelled with partner,Beautiful property. Central location. Professional staff. Very friendly and accommodating. Will be back !
Fairmont Royal York,5,Liked,Business Traveller,Great hotel and very helpful Land friendly staff. Just too bad that all of their facilities are closed because of Covid restrictions.
Fairmont Royal York,3,Disliked,Travelled with partner,"The hotel is nice and in a good location. The hotel and room was clean and nice. The room was fairly small and I selected the King luxury room. The real disappointment was the service. Whenever I called the front desk or concierge I was met with a bad attitude and rude comments. The other disappointment was parking l, it is about $50 a night which I found to be very pricey."
Fairmont Royal York,4,Liked,Business Traveller,Great location. Due to pandemic hotel was quiet which was great. Very clean and safe.

One King West Hotel & Residence,5,Liked,Travelled with partner,I really liked the interior. Staff was very nice. Ana helped us check-in. She gave us very nice customer service. We would love to visit again.
One King West Hotel & Residence,3,Liked,Travelled with partner,"The location is the best part of this hotel. The room was okay, the bathroom needed updating in my opinion - very old and there was lots of dirt along the baseboards. I brought cleaning wipes with me and I used them to wipe things down in the room. It was okay overall."
One King West Hotel & Residence,3,Liked,Business Traveller,"Booking completed through Expedia, but upon checkout was refused full itemized listing receipt from hotel directly. Expedia only listed room charge and not the additional parking and meals charged to the room. Hotel not budging for assistance. Poor exit from a good start."

Courtyard by Marriott Downtown Toronto,4,Liked,Travelled with group,"I like the size and layout of the room. It was very big and spacious. Although some of the amenities weren’t accessible, we didn’t stay much at the hotel anyways. The tv didn’t connect our phones which was unfortunate but overall the stay was great."

EST Hotel,3,Liked,Travelled with partner,"The room was wonderful, very pleased. But the hotel staff didn’t set or even practice covid 19 safety measures. Not only was some of the staff not wearing masks but almost everyone in the hotel wasn’t while they were around the facility.. this made me very uncomfortable and felt unsafe while staying."
EST Hotel,5,Liked,Travelled with partner,Service was great.
EST Hotel,3,Disliked,Travelled with partner,"We weren't looking for fancy, just a 2 day get away. Our room heating wasn't working and it was really cold but the front desk brought has a space heater that helped a lot. We couldn't connect our phones to the TV and our power to our room went off for a few hours."
EST Hotel,2,Disliked,Business Traveller,Nasty. Only nice part about this hotel is the lobby
EST Hotel,1,Disliked,Travelled with group,"Horrible experience! Key card not provided. Asked if breakfast was included, didn’t have an answer. Room provided smelled of stale smoke. Was transferred to another room that looked like a $50 Motel room. Transferred to another room that was much more presentable but the coffe creamers curdled, the sink was not cleaned. No social distancing and hallway was noisy as hell. 2am in the morning some lady was crying like she was beaten. 2 star, not worth the price and a waste of money. Front desk workers played alot of mind games - very untrustworthy!"
Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto,4,Liked,Travelled with partner,View was super amazing! Definitely worth the price for each night! Staff was SUPER friendly and helpful with everything! Would definitely recommend
Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto,5,Liked,Travelled with partner,"The hotel staff are responsive and friendly. The hotel breakfast was also pretty good. However, I wish they had proper cups and glasses in the rooms instead of using so much plastic."

Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto,4,Liked,Travelled with partner,The parking was a real inconvenience $36 a day without In/Out privileges
Delta Hotels by Marriott Toronto,5,Liked,Business Traveller,Great access to the underground PATH and shuttles & trains I was very impressed with the room was beautiful Staff was amazing & very accommodating FIVE STAR service
Toronto Travellers Home,1,Disliked,Business Traveller,"The place was very un organized at One point somebody tried to come in my room because the person who checked me and did not tell them that the room I was in was taken. The bed sheets were not washed after the last person used it, I found the loose hair of the last person there. There was no microwave in my room so there was no way to warm up food etc. There was other people’s soaps and shampoos in the washroom. Very dirty and very unorganized !"
Toronto Travellers Home,2,Disliked,Travelled with family,I paid for tv laundry and never got it ended up paying for a private washroom on top of the original price. Still didn’t even get my key deposit back. Every time I call he makes it ring out. I called from a different number and he answered told me to text and I didn’t still no reply. This has got to be the absolute worst experience I’ve had. I would not even recommend this place to my enemy.
Toronto Travellers Home,3,Liked,Business Traveller,The property was horrible and Expedia is showing 3* I am really disappointed I am a hotelier and I will never recommend any of my family or friends to use Expedia because Expedia is not caring about guest
Toronto Travellers Home,3,Liked,Business Traveller,"Its a rooming house in Chinatown and if you like adventure, are not scared of your own shadow, don't need quiet when you sleep, can get by with just a bed/bathroom/fan on a table/chair, and can eat out all the time...its a good cheap place to stay but the price does go up each time if you extend, and on arrival if you don't pay attention! Good for solo or couples, but not for family for sure."
Toronto Travellers Home,2,Disliked,Travelled with group ,I paid a deposit for the key to get it back when I check out!! I did what I’m supposed to do but haven’t reserved my money back yet!!! Called the guy so many times but he was like send me a message!! I did couple of times but didn’t get the money yet!!!
St Lawrence Residences And Suites,2,Disliked,Business Traveller,"I didn't stay in the hotel and you processed my card without my authorization, if you you don't refund my money, i will sue you. Thanks"
St Lawrence Residences And Suites,2,Disliked,Business Traveller,all the place is built from scraps. i booked a room 1 day before my arivel and they just canceled my room and said that my card was canceled(didnt happend) and i had to pay them 80$ more! it was in new year eve and the money i payed was sooo much for so low economy
St Lawrence Residences And Suites,4,Liked,Travelled with family,"We (a group of 6 young women) were left with no choice but to stay here last minute after a mistake with a hostel booking on NYE. The man who checked us in was extremely chatty and slightly over the top. He talked to us about murder and I’m not sure what he did behind the counter with our IDs and credit cards. The rooms and common area are not bad if slightly unusual but cleanliness was good. There were lots of amenities that we could use. The walls are very thin, two in our group could hear very loud noises from the bedroom above and the rest of us could hear a very loud argument at 3am. Overall it was okay as there were 6 of us but I would not feel comfortable there on my own or even in a smaller group. We did not feel overerly safe here and got quite weird vibes from the place. We had no issues with our stay but one night was definitely enough and I feel we were lucky to not have anything go too wrong during our stay."
